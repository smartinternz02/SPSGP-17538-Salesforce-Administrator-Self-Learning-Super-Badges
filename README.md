Project Description:

Salesforce Administrator Careers

You put the "I" in impact. You bring innovation to life, bridging the gap between business requirements and technology. For your company, this means automating complex business processes, creating reports and dashboards, and training users on Salesforce. For your team, it means helping them stay efficient and on top of things while keeping an eye on their successes and customer relationships.

What’s Salesforce? Salesforce is a customer relationship management solution that gives every business team?—from sales and marketing to commerce, service, and beyond—a single, shared view of every customer.
